# Building-a-Stock-Candlestick-Chart-Using-Python
The purpose of this notebook is to use python to build a candlestick stock chart. In the script, we will pull historical stock data from the Yahoo Finance API and use several python libraries to visualize the data using (specifically) a OHLC - or "candlestick" - chart of the data. We're using GOOG stock price / volume data for Q1 and Q2 of 2022. 

Thanks,
Joe
